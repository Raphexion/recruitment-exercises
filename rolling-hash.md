# Rolling Hash Algorithm in Rust
_Spec v3 (2020-05-05)_

Make a rolling hash based file diffing algorithm in Rust. When compared with two different inputs, it should return the exact chunk(s) that have changed.
The real-world use case for this type of construct could be a distributed file storage system. This reduces the need for bandwidth and storage. If many people have the same file stored on Dropbox, for example, there's no need to upload it again.

## Requirements
- Hashing function gets the data as a parameter. Separate possible filesystem operations.
- Chunk size can be fixed or dynamic, but must be split to at least two chunks on any sufficiently sized data.
- Should be able to recognize changes between chunks. Only the exact differing locations should be added to the delta.
- Well-written unit tests function well in describing the operation, no UI necessary.
